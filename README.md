# CSS Preloader

This project is a CSS preloader, following along with a tutorial from Dev Ed, in order to learn the basics of animations in the browser.

# What I learned
- CSS vmin
- CSS @media combined with orientation: landscape
- Different background images for different screen rotations
- Flex column reverse
- CSS keyframes
- CSS animation basics with infinite loop, alternate and ease-in-out
